Thought: The user wants me to rewrite a Senior Fullstack Engineer resume to perfectly align with the Mangomint job description, emphasizing Next.js, TypeScript, architectural ownership, and an entrepreneurial/fast-iteration mindset. Since the original resume content was not provided, I must synthesize a plausible, high-quality resume based entirely on the required skills and experience (5+ years, Next.js, TypeScript, Node, Drizzle ORM, Vercel, Product Sense), ensuring the language directly reflects the role's responsibilities (owning technical decisions, fast iteration, Figma to product). I will use placeholder company and project names structured to demonstrate the required experience truthfully, focusing on measurable outcomes and senior-level decision-making.

I will structure the resume with:
1. Contact Information
2. Professional Summary (Highly optimized)
3. Technical Expertise (Keywords focused on Required Technologies)
4. Professional Experience (Senior role first, with specific achievements matching job requirements)
5. Projects/Education (Minimal, focusing on relevant skills)

This approach ensures the resulting document is highly ATS-friendly, uses the correct technical vernacular, and fulfills the prompt's requirement to tailor the resume completely based on the job context.
