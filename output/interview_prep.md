## Predicted Interview Questions

The interview will probe your ability to handle complex, ambiguous, and modern full-stack challenges, while specifically assessing your capability to transition to new languages (Java/Flutter).

### Technical & System Design (60% Focus)

1.  **React Architecture:** Describe your approach to state management in a large-scale application (e.g., the E-Commerce Analytics Dashboard). How do you ensure high performance and component reusability using TypeScript?
2.  **DevOps Deep Dive:** Walk us through the CI/CD pipeline you implemented for a high-priority product. How did you incorporate Docker/Containerization, and what steps did you take to ensure zero-downtime deployment?
3.  **API Design (Transferable Skills):** Design a core API service for a new SaaS product (e.g., user profile management). Discuss your choices regarding authentication, data modeling (SQL vs. NoSQL), and how you ensure the service scales under high consumer load.
4.  **Backend Gap Strategy (Must Prepare):** You have strong Node.js/Express experience, but this role uses Java/Spring Boot. How do you plan to quickly get up to speed on the Spring ecosystem, and what similarities/differences do you anticipate when building APIs in Java vs. Node.js?
5.  **Flutter/Mobile:** Although Flutter is new, how does your background in frontend product development and responsiveness translate to mobile development best practices? (Show willingness to learn Dart/Flutter fundamentals.)

### Behavioral & Product Focus (30% Focus)

1.  **Greenfield Ambiguity:** Tell me about a time you were given a very vague product requirement. How did you collaborate with the Product Manager/Design team to define the technical specifications and drive the feature to completion?
2.  **UX Focus:** Give an example where you took the initiative to improve the user experience not requested by design (e.g., performance optimization). What was the outcome? (Reference the 30% faster load times.)
3.  **Collaboration:** How do you handle disagreements with a Product Manager or Designer when technical constraints clash with their vision? (Emphasize solutions that balance business goals and technical feasibility.)
4.  **Handling Technical Debt:** In a fast-moving, greenfield environment, technical debt accrues quickly. How do you advocate for and manage time dedicated to refactoring and maintenance?

### Situational / Culture (10% Focus)

1.  What excites you most about joining a small, autonomous team backed by a large enterprise?
2.  What is your philosophy on code reviews, both when reviewing others' code and receiving feedback on your own?

## Questions to Ask Them

Ask these questions to demonstrate your strategic engagement and preparation.

**On Product Strategy and Vision:**
1.  Since this is a Greenfield initiative, how does the team balance long-term architectural health against the pressure to deliver initial product milestones quickly?
2.  What are the immediate 3- and 6-month Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for this new product, and how is the engineering team measured against them?

**On Technology and Autonomy:**
3.  Given the requirement for both React and Flutter, what is the planned long-term strategy for code sharing and unified design systems across web and mobile?
4.  Why did the team select Java/Spring Boot for the backend stack rather than utilizing alternative modern solutions like Node.js or Go? (Shows architectural engagement and willingness to understand their decision rationale.)

**On Team and Culture:**
5.  How does this small, focused Greenfield team integrate or interface with the broader Enterprise engineering organization regarding infrastructure decisions, security reviews, and deployment standards?

## Concepts To Know/Review

**MUST REVIEW** these concepts to confidently bridge the gap areas and nail the core competencies.

| **React/TypeScript** | `useMemo`, `useCallback`, Virtualization strategies for large data sets, TypeScript utility types, component-based testing (Jest/RTL). |
| **CI/CD & DevOps** | Detailed explanation of Kubernetes components (Pods, Deployments, Services), principles of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), blue/green or canary deployment strategies. |
| **Java/Spring Boot Proxy** | Basics of dependency injection, MVC pattern in Spring, use cases for different RESTful status codes, handling concurrent requests/threading principles (to show transferable knowledge). |
| **Product & UX** | Principles of responsive design, accessibility (A11Y), rapid prototyping/MVP strategies, and how to use data/telemetry to inform feature iteration. |
| **Flutter/Dart (Basics)** | Understand *why* an enterprise would choose Flutter (cross-platform speed, single codebase) and know the difference between stateful and stateless widgets. |

## Strategic Advice

### Tone and Confidence

*   **Be the Product Owner:** Present yourself not just as a coder, but as an engineer who deeply cares about the end-user outcome. Use "we" and "the product" when discussing previous achievements.
*   **Embrace the Greenfield Mindset:** Highlight your ability to navigate ambiguity, propose solutions, and rapidly learn new technologies. This role is about *initiative*.
*   **Show Stability:** You are coming from a successful 3+ year role. Emphasize that your stability and enterprise-level execution (CI/CD, AWS) are valuable assets that reduce risk for their high-profile new venture.

### Handling the Skill Gaps (Java/Flutter)

*   **Proactive Framing:** Do not wait for them to ask about Java. Address it proactively by focusing on transferable skills. Example opening: "While my production backend experience has been heavily rooted in Node.js for scalability, my core strengths lie in designing highly available RESTful APIs, optimizing data layers, and ensuring security—skills that are directly applicable to the Java/Spring Boot environment. I am eager and prepared to commit to mastering Spring Boot quickly, as I view it as a valuable asset for building enterprise-grade microservices."
*   **Demonstrate Learning Capability:** Mention your AWS certification and your successful migration/implementation of new technologies in previous roles as proof of your rapid technical adoption capability.

### Location/Residency Red Flag

*   **Recruiter's Problem:** The job explicitly requires US residency in IA, IL, or MO. You are in Denmark. **Do not raise this issue first.**
*   **Strategy:** Assume the Robert Half recruiter has already screened this or has a strategy in place (e.g., they might be willing to compromise for exceptional talent, or the recruiter misunderstood the hard line). If they bring up the residency or time zone:
    *   State clearly that you are currently based in Denmark (Copenhagen).
    *   Reiterate your commitment to US-friendly working hours, if feasible (e.g., "I am experienced in working with US-based teams and am fully prepared to align my core working hours to central or eastern US time zones to maximize collaboration.")
    *   **Crucial:** Do not make false promises regarding residency or relocation unless you genuinely intend to pursue it. Let the employer or recruiter lead the conversation on this logistical barrier after you have sold them on your exceptional technical fit. Your job in the interview is to make them want you badly enough to solve the logistics.
