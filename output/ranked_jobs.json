            "reason": "Technically the strongest fit among the list (React, TypeScript, 3+ years experience, CI/CD, permanent role). However, the backend requires Java/Spring Boot (a shift from Node.js), and the explicit residency requirement (IA, IL, or MO) is a firm disqualifier for a candidate based in Denmark."
