    "selected": true,
    "reason": "This permanent role offers the strongest alignment with the candidate's experience level (3+ years), utilizes the candidate's core frontend skill (React.js/TypeScript), and aligns with career goals (Greenfield SaaS, CI/CD, high compensation). It is the best technical match, even though the backend requires Java/Spring Boot (a manageable shift from Node.js) and the mandatory US state residency requirement is a known geographical barrier common to all jobs listed."
